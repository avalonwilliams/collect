collect

Collects lines from stdin before writing them into a file. Allows constructing
pipelines that read from and write to the same file.

Works similarly to sponge from moreutils, though the internal code is much simpler
than the moreutils equivalent.

I wrote this because plan9port's sed command doesn't have a -i option, (and I wasn't
aware of sponge at the time), though it can be useful in a number of other places as well.
